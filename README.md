# Translator-
A project were we can translate 
1.Speech to speech
  We can input a voice in two ways
    1.Through a mp3 audio file(The code will automatically translate .mp3 to .wav)
    2.Through our system Microphone
or by
2.Text to speech
  We can simply enter text it translate into speech.
Output:
1.The translate output in translated language text. 
2.The translated output save as a audio(.mp3)file in our system.
3.Generate url and play the translated output.
I used googletrans,speech_recognition and gtts APIs libaries and pydub(Translating into .mp3 to .wav file) and playsound(For play the audio).
Thank you,I Hope you like it.
