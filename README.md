# Translator-
Hii everyone,
This is a project were we can translate 
1.Speech to speech
  We can input a voice in two ways
    1.Through a mp3 audio file(The code will automatically translate .mp3 to .wav)
    2.Through our system Microphone
or by
2.Text to speech
  We can simply enter text it translate into speech.
More features:
1.The translate input can be save directly in system.
2.Can translate into more then 100+ languages.
3.It will generate a url of the translated audio too.
4.It not only translate to speech but to text also.
example:If we give a english language input from audio file or text or through microphone
        then we can convert into any language suppose say hindi then the output will be a
        1.The translate text in Hindi text
        2.Hindi voice file save in directory 
        3.A url of your translated speech
        4.It will automatically play the transalted audio too.
I used googletrans,speech_recognition and gtts APIs libaries and pydub(Translating into .mp3 to .wav file) and playsound(For play the audio).
Thank you,I Hope you like it.
